## v1.37.1 - 2026-06-22

### Security

- The build transform that removes `gray-matter`'s dead JS-frontmatter engine now strips the **entire `engines.javascript` registration**, not just its `eval()` call. Neutralizing only the call left the surrounding string-building scaffolding (`'(function(){ return ' + str + '}())'`) in the minified bundle, which an LLM-based scanner still reads as a remote-code-execution sink even with zero literal `eval(`. Replacing the whole engine with an inert throwing stub leaves nothing to cite. Behavior is unchanged — that engine is dead under the YAML-only `safeLoad` path the parser uses — and the guard still fails the build if a dependency bump relocates the block. Applies to both the CLI bundle and the dashboard server bundle.
- `/dev-wiki` now frames the cross-project `.dev/` and `.dev-archive/` markdown it scans as **untrusted data, not instructions** — catalogued, never obeyed. A new "Untrusted Input" section foregrounds that generation is deterministic and CLI-bound, that the skill has no `Edit`/`Write` capability and runs no command found inside a PRD, and that the generated wiki is itself a catalog of untrusted metadata for downstream readers. This mirrors the `/dev-review` untrusted-input scoping shipped in 1.37.0 and targets the prompt-injection category on the skill.

## v1.37.0 - 2026-06-22

### Security

- The bundled `dev-workflow.cjs` CLI now ships with **zero dynamic-code-execution primitives**. A guarded esbuild transform strips `gray-matter`'s `eval()` (its optional JS-frontmatter engine) and `js-yaml`'s `new Function()` (the `!!js/function` type) from every shipped copy at build time — both were dead code under the YAML-only `safeLoad` path the parser actually uses, so PRD parsing is byte-for-byte unchanged. This removes the remote-code-execution surface that drove the `/dev-wiki` security rating and the `usesEval` dependency alerts on the bundle. The transform is guarded — the build fails if a dependency bump relocates either pattern, so a primitive can never silently re-ship — and a bundle smoke test that runs the real `.cjs` (not the TS source, which never loads the shipped artifact) is now part of the test suite.
- `/dev-review` now treats every PRD, checkpoint, and diff it ingests as **untrusted data, not instructions**. The `feature-reporter` subagent receives that markdown wrapped in XML-like boundary markers (`<prd-content>`, `<checkpoint-content>`, `<diff>`), behind a foregrounded mandatory user-review gate, with its `Edit` capability scoped to the feature's own `.dev/` docs — mirroring the structure that keeps `/dev-checkpoint` from being flagged for the same prompt-injection category. The boundary is enforced in both the skill and the bundled `feature-reporter` agent.
- `/dev-wiki`'s filesystem writes are now documented as bounded to `~/.dev-wiki`, covering both the CLI generator and the dashboard write site.

### Changed

- The dev-dashboard server now binds to **`127.0.0.1` (loopback) by default** instead of `0.0.0.0`. LAN exposure is opt-in via `--lan`, `--host <addr>`, or `DEV_DASHBOARD_HOST` (precedence: CLI > env > stored > default), and a LAN bind logs a warning at startup. The bind host is intentionally **not** settable through the HTTP API, so a web request can never flip the server to a LAN-exposed address. The dashboard port file is now read by a committed `read-port.cjs` (config path passed as an argv, not string-interpolated) instead of an inline `node -e`, removing the last dynamic-code surface from the launch path.

### Removed

- The dev-dashboard `~/.local/bin` shim-install chain — `install.sh`, `check-install.sh`, and the runtime `chmod`/`node -e` they relied on. The `/dev-dashboard` skill now launches `start.sh`/`stop.sh` directly by absolute path, and skills already invoke the bundled CLI by absolute path, so the shims had no load-bearing consumer. Removing the install capability outright (rather than hardening it) clears the `COMMAND_EXECUTION` driver behind the dev-dashboard rating. Existing user-installed shims keep working but are now unmanaged.

## v1.36.0 - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- `/dev-review` now produces a **concise, scannable** report — a header plus three sections (a deviations table, future-affecting constraints as bullets, and an untested-areas table), each row carrying a verdict chip (✅ / 🔶 / 🔴) and a `file:line` — instead of the previous four-section prose report. It is built for the architect who knows the overall picture and triages in under a minute. The `feature-reporter` agent still explores the codebase deeply (checkboxes are not trusted) and is now explicitly guarded against over-claiming — scope a "unused" claim precisely, verify before characterizing — but the deliverable is tables and bullets, not a wall of prose.
- After presenting, `/dev-review` offers to apply the documentation corrections it surfaces (the report's "Your call" column) back to the feature's PRD and checkpoint, per item on explicit confirmation. The skill's scope widened from review-only to report-plus-doc-write-backs: it may now `Edit` **only** the feature's own `.dev/<feature>/` PRD and checkpoint markdown, and never code.

### Removed

- The `/dev-review` "save to `.dev/<feature>/review.md`" step. The saved report was read by nothing — not the dashboard, the wiki, or any skill — so it produced a parallel artifact with no downstream consumer. Its durable value (the doc corrections) now flows into the PRD and checkpoint that future sessions actually read.

## v1.35.0 - 2026-06-12

### Added

- `/dev-review` skill: generates an architect-readable PRD-vs-implementation alignment report. It spawns a fresh `feature-reporter` subagent that explores the codebase (rather than trusting PRD checkboxes) and reports in four sections — deviations first, then what was built and how it works, the limits imposed by architectural constraints, and what remains untested. The audience is the architect who designed the feature but has not read the code. It is review-only: it never edits project files, never emits verdict tags, and writes `.dev/<feature>/review.md` only after explicit confirmation. Use it when a feature's implementation is finished (or nearly), before final testing. `/dev-resume` now suggests it at the final phase gate.

### Changed

- `/dev-checkpoint` now asks and executes the branch/worktree and commit decisions **before** updating PRD markers and writing the checkpoint, instead of after. Previously a branch created at the end of the skill landed after the checkpoint was written, so the next `/dev-resume` saw a branch mismatch and reported `drifted`. With commit-first ordering the saved checkpoint records the branch and commit the session actually ends on; the marker edits and checkpoint files written after the commit are honestly recorded as `uncommittedChanges: true` and swept into the next session's commit. The worktree sub-flow retargets all paths into the worktree and defers the "restart in the worktree" instruction to the final summary, so the checkpoint is written before the user is told to leave. Declining the commit no longer ends the skill early — the checkpoint is still saved.

### Removed

- The `dev-judge`, `dev-afk`, and `dev-quiz` skills, along with all their supporting machinery: the `phase-reviewer` agent, verdict parsing in `dev-workflow-core` (`parseVerdict`/`parseFeedback`/the `Verdict` type and fixtures), AFK-runnability classification (`afk-runnable.ts`), and the `--afk` flag plus `afk` JSON field on the `dev-workflow list` command. These were built around ralph-loop-driven unattended automation and have not been used in real projects; Claude Code's native `/loop` supersedes `dev-afk`, and `dev-judge`/`dev-quiz` mainly existed as its quality gates. The `list` command itself remains as a general feature-listing tool.

## v1.34.0 - 2026-06-03

### Changed

- User-local command shims (`dev-workflow`, `dev-dashboard`, `dev-dashboard-stop`) installed by the dev-dashboard skill are now **self-resolving across versions**. Previously each shim baked the absolute path of the marketplace-cache version it was installed from (`…/cache/dev-workflow/dev-workflow/<version>/…`), so every `/plugin update` left the shims pointing at the old, now-superseded bundle until the install script happened to be re-run — the standalone `dev-workflow` command and any shim-launched dashboard silently kept running stale code. For a cached install the shim now bakes only the version-stripped root and resolves the newest installed version at runtime, so a `/plugin update` is picked up with zero reinstall. The body is version-independent, so `check-install.sh` no longer reports a freshly-updated install as `stale`, and an older version-pinned shim upgrades cleanly to the self-resolving form on the next install run. Contributor-mode shims (pointing at the repo's `plugins/` tree) are unchanged.

### Added

- `dev-dashboard --restart` (and `start.sh --restart`): stop any running bundled dashboard server — across cache versions — then start a fresh one from the newest bundle, in a single command. Intended for use right after a `/plugin update` to reload the long-lived server, which a code update alone can't refresh.
- Regression coverage: the install suite builds a fake multi-version marketplace cache and asserts a shim installed from an older version runs the newest at runtime and tracks a newly-appeared version with no reinstall; the stop suite statically asserts the `--restart` wiring without spawning or killing a server (so it can't disturb a developer's real dashboard).

## v1.33.0 - 2026-06-03

### Added

- The status-marker parser now recognizes `⏹️` (emoji) and the words `MERGED`, `CLOSED`, and `DEFERRED` as resolved markers, alongside the existing `✅`/`⏭️`/`⛔`/`DONE`/`SHIPPED`/`DROPPED`/`SKIPPED` set. These show up naturally when an effort is wrapped up — a phase noted `✅ MERGED end-to-end`, an investigation `✅ CLOSED`, a track `⏹️ DEFERRED` to a future PRD — but were previously invisible to the parser, so a feature that was genuinely done still read as `gate`/`in-progress` and never surfaced the dashboard's Archive action. The new tokens are added everywhere markers are counted: numbered and bullet step counters, the sub-PRD Implementation Progress table, the leading prose phase-marker line, and the `**Status**:` header fallback. Deferred work is treated as terminal (resolved), consistent with how `⛔ Dropped` and `⏭️ Skipped` already behaved.
- `normalizeEmoji()` maps the `:stop_button:` shortcode to `⏹️`.
- Test fixtures extended to cover the new markers: `master-with-prose-status/` gains `✅ MERGED`, `⏹️ DEFERRED`, and `✅ CLOSED` phases, and `subprd-mixed-steps/` gains a `⏹️ Deferred` step row.

## v1.32.1 - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- Sub-PRD step counting in `dev-workflow-core` no longer silently drops steps whose row format deviates from `| **N** |`. The Implementation Progress row regex in `parseSubPrd()` previously required a purely-numeric, bold step identifier, so any track-lettered or dotted ID (`3A`, `3A.1`, `3G`) and any non-bold ID (`| 1 |`) was skipped — undercounting totals and, worse, hiding completed work (e.g. a shipped `✅` step labelled `3G` reported the whole sub-PRD as `0/3 Not Started`). The regex now accepts an optionally-bold identifier that merely starts with a digit (`\*{0,2}(\d[\w.]*)\*{0,2}`), so the `| Step |` header and `|---|` separator rows still never match. `SubPrdStep.number` changed from `number` to `string` to preserve IDs faithfully (`"3A.1"`), and step descriptions are now captured in the same pass instead of a second whole-document scan.
- The `⛔` (Dropped) marker is now recognized everywhere step markers are counted — both the sub-PRD table and the phase-level numbered/bullet step counters — and counts as resolved (like `⏭️` Skipped), so a sub-PRD with a dropped track can still reach `complete` instead of being stuck `in-progress`.
- New regression fixture `subprd-mixed-steps/` exercises track-lettered, plain non-bold, and `⛔`-dropped rows in one table.

## v1.32.0 - 2026-05-24

### Added
- Cross-project full-text search across core, CLI, server API, and dashboard UI. Type natural queries like "forge migration" in the dashboard search box to instantly find matching features across all projects with status badges, progress bars, and contextual snippets.
- `searchFeatures()` pure function in `dev-workflow-core` with multi-word AND matching across name, summary, nextAction, branch, and currentPhase fields.
- `search` CLI command with `--query`, `--project`, `--status`, `--scan`, `--max`, `--json` flags.
- `GET /api/search?q=&project=&status=` server route backed by in-memory project state.
- SearchPanel overlay component with keyboard navigation, term highlighting, loading skeletons, and results grouped by project.

## v1.31.0 - 2026-05-23

### Added
- Wiki generator: cross-project markdown wiki from `.dev/` and `.dev-archive/` PRDs, auto-generated by the dashboard server and available via `dev-workflow wiki-index --generate` CLI. Browsable in Obsidian, queryable by skills as lightweight RAG.
- Dashboard server integration: `wikiDir` config option, debounced wiki regeneration on all state changes, `GET /api/wiki` endpoint serving the wiki index as JSON.
- `wiki-index` CLI command with `--json`, `--generate`, `--scan`, `--out` flags.
- `/dev-wiki` skill for on-demand wiki generation and Obsidian vault setup.
- `/dev-plan` now consults `~/.dev-wiki/index.md` for cross-project prior art before researching (skips silently when absent).
- `/dev-resume` optionally references `~/.dev-wiki/index.md` for cross-project context when reading key files.

## v1.30.4 - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- `dev-dashboard-stop` now stops a dashboard server still running from a prior version's cache path after `/plugin update`. The `find_pids()` helper in `plugins/dev-workflow/skills/dev-dashboard/scripts/stop.sh` previously matched processes against the current install's absolute `SERVER_ENTRY` path, so a server launched from `…/cache/dev-workflow/dev-workflow/1.30.3/skills/dev-dashboard/dashboard/server/index.cjs` was invisible to a `dev-dashboard-stop` invoked from the 1.30.4 cache — the stale process kept the port and the next `dev-dashboard` start either failed or silently picked a different port. The helper now matches on `SERVER_ENTRY_PATTERN="/skills/dev-dashboard/dashboard/server/index.cjs"`, the stable path suffix shared by every cached or contributor-mode install. This is the same class of cross-version staleness fixed for the workflow CLI shim in v1.30.3. New `tests/test-dev-dashboard-stop.sh` regression test spawns a fake bundled server at a cross-version-shaped path and asserts the pattern matches it via `pgrep -f`; the test deliberately does not invoke `stop.sh` end-to-end so it never disturbs a developer's real running dashboard.

## v1.30.3 - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- `/dev-dashboard`'s install script now refreshes the `dev-workflow` CLI shim across plugin upgrades instead of marking it as `conflict`. `is_managed_workflow_shim()` (in `plugins/dev-workflow/skills/dev-dashboard/scripts/install.sh`) and its companion `workflow_is_managed()` (in `check-install.sh`) previously only recognized a shim as theirs if it pointed at the *current* version's exact target path or the contributor-mode `/plugins/dev-workflow/bin/dev-workflow.cjs`. Any shim written by a prior version (e.g. one pointing at `…/cache/dev-workflow/dev-workflow/1.29.0/bin/dev-workflow.cjs`) was treated as foreign, so terminal calls to `dev-workflow` stayed pinned to the old bundle even after `/plugin update` brought down the new version. The matchers now also accept any shim whose body contains both `/cache/dev-workflow/dev-workflow/` and `/bin/dev-workflow.cjs`, so the installer rewrites it to the current target on the next run. New regression test in `tests/test-dev-dashboard-install.sh` locks in the cross-version refresh path while keeping the existing "unrelated command" conflict guard intact.

## v1.30.2 - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- `/dev-dashboard` and the CLI now read phase status correctly for master + sub-PRD plans. When a phase in `00-master-plan.md` delegates to a sub-PRD (no enumerated steps in the body — just a `See [sub-prd]` pointer and a status sentence like `✅ **DONE** (date): …`), the parser previously read the phase as `not-started`, so `currentPhase` could stay stuck on a phase that had actually shipped across many sessions. `extractPhases` in `tools/dev-workflow-core/src/parser.ts` now scans the first content line under each phase heading (skipping blanks and an optional `See [link]` pointer) for an emoji status marker plus one of DONE / SHIPPED / COMPLETE / DROPPED / SKIPPED / NOT STARTED / TODO / IN PROGRESS. Unrelated emoji deeper in the section don't trigger the fallback. New parser fixture `master-with-prose-status` covers the five common marker shapes.

## v1.30.1 - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- `/dev-dashboard` no longer goes stale when chokidar misses a filesystem event. The watcher in `tools/dev-dashboard/src/server/watcher.ts` reacts to `add`/`change`/`unlink` events from chokidar v4, which on macOS uses Node's native `fs.watch` (no fsevents) and can silently drop events — especially across sleep/wake on long-running processes. New features added to `.dev/` after the dashboard started could remain invisible until restart. A 5-minute periodic rescan in `tools/dev-dashboard/src/server/index.ts` now calls `scanProjects()` against the current scan dirs, diffs the result against the in-memory state, and broadcasts `full_refresh` only when something changed (no needless client re-renders on idle ticks).

## v1.30.0 - 2026-05-09

### Dashboard detail panel polish

The feature detail panel in `/dev-dashboard` gets three coordinated upgrades that change how you read your in-flight work.

**What you'll notice:**
- **Markdown rendering for NEXT ACTION, DECISIONS, and BLOCKERS.** Headings render as small uppercase sky-tinted labels, numbered lists get muted Plex Mono numerals, and inline `code` shows up as cyan terminal chips — your checkpoint markdown finally renders the way you wrote it instead of as one wall of plain text.
- **Open-externally toolbar.** Three ghost icon buttons in the new panel header open the feature's `checkpoint.md` in the OS default app, reveal it in Finder/Explorer, or open a terminal at the feature directory. macOS and Linux paths are clean; Windows terminal mode is best-effort (`wt.exe` if present). The Archive/Restore button moves to the far right of the same header bar.
- **Session History collapsible.** A new section at the bottom of the panel surfaces parsed `session-log.md` entries — newest first, sky border + LATEST pill on the freshest entry, slate on older ones. Each entry has its own collapse state; the top two newest start expanded.

### Added
- `POST /api/projects/:project/features/:feature/open` route in the dashboard server. Takes a mode enum (`open` | `reveal` | `terminal`) and dispatches per-platform launchers via `execFile` with discrete arg arrays — the client never sends a path, so there's no shell-injection surface.
- `marked@^15` for client-side markdown rendering. Scoped CSS lives under `@layer components` in `styles.css` so Tailwind utilities still win the cascade if you need to override on a specific instance.
- `sessionLog` field on `FeatureDetail` API responses (populated array when `session-log.md` exists, `null` when absent).
- `parseSessionLog` and `SessionLogEntry` re-exported from the dashboard server's parser.
- Mockup at `.dev/dashboard-detail-ui-enhancements/mockup.html` (gitignored) — visual reference for the redesigned panel.

### Fixed
- Features with a complete master plan and a pending sub-PRD no longer show as `complete`. The parser was only consulting sub-PRD step counts when the master plan had zero inline steps, so any sub-PRD added as an extension after the original feature shipped was invisible to the dashboard, the CLI, and `/dev-afk`. `parseFeature` now adds sub-PRD step counts to the master plan total whenever the master plan is fully complete, and `currentPhase` falls back to the first pending sub-PRD phase so AFK can pick up the work. The in-progress case is unchanged — sub-PRDs there typically describe master-plan work in detail and combining the two would double-count.

### Internal
- 116 dashboard tests passing (108 prior + 6 markdown helpers + 7 open route + 2 sessionLog API).
- New `tools/dev-dashboard/src/client/lib/markdown.ts` with `render()` / `renderInline()` helpers, configured once at module load with `{ gfm: true, breaks: false }`. Trust boundary documented inline (local PRD content; layer DOMPurify here if the surface ever extends to remote content).
- The existing watcher already picks up `session-log.md` changes — no extension needed.
- New parser fixture `master-complete-subprd-pending` covering the additive aggregation case (4 master plan steps done + 3 sub-PRD steps pending → 4/7, status `active`).

### Configurable terminal + tabbed Configuration panel

The Configuration panel that opened from the gear icon used to be a single scan-dirs form. It now hosts four tabs, and the previously-hardcoded terminal that opens from the feature toolbar's terminal icon is finally user-pickable.

**What you'll notice:**
- **Pick your terminal app.** Configuration → Terminal lets you choose from a preset dropdown (Terminal, iTerm2, WezTerm, Ghostty, Kitty, Alacritty, Warp on macOS; gnome-terminal, Konsole, WezTerm, Kitty, Alacritty on Linux; Windows Terminal, WezTerm, Alacritty on Windows). Custom… reveals discrete Command + Arguments fields with `{{cwd}}` substitution at launch. The setting persists per platform, so a synced `~/.config/dev-dashboard/config.json` keeps each OS's preference intact when you save from another.
- **Tabbed Configuration.** Scan directories / Terminal / Notifications / About, with proper WAI-ARIA `role="tablist"` semantics and arrow-key navigation (Left/Right/Home/End cycle focus and activate).
- **Notifications toggle.** A new `role="switch"` control persists your preference alongside the rest of the dashboard config. The runtime daemon hasn't shipped yet — the toggle just remembers the choice for when it does.
- **About tab.** Read-only summary of the plugin version, config file path, platform, and counts of watched projects and features. Useful when reporting issues or sanity-checking what the dashboard is actually scanning.

### Added
- `terminal: { darwin?, linux?, win32? }` field on `DashboardConfig`, with each entry either a preset id string or `{ cmd, args[] }` for custom mode. POSTs merge per-platform so a save from one OS doesn't clobber the others; sending `null` for a platform clears that entry.
- `DashboardConfigResponse` wrapper on `GET` and `POST /api/config` carrying `platform` / `version` / `configPath` alongside the persisted config — the client About tab and the platform-aware Terminal tab fetch in one round-trip.
- `tools/dev-dashboard/src/server/terminal-presets.ts` with `KNOWN_TERMINALS` registry and a pure `resolveTerminalCommand()` resolver. Each preset carries a `(cwd) => { cmd, args }` recipe; the open-route's terminal mode consults the user's setting first and falls back to `buildOpenCommand` when nothing's configured. Discrete-args invariant preserved end-to-end — no shell parsing, no `.split(' ')`, never an `exec()` call.
- `tools/dev-dashboard/src/client/terminal-presets.ts` with the matching label table plus form-state helpers (`TerminalDraft`, `deriveTerminalDraft`, `draftToSetting`, `isTerminalDraftDirty`).
- Inline `Toggle` primitive in `ConfigurationPanel.tsx` (`<button role="switch">` with `aria-checked` + `aria-labelledby`, native Space/Enter, focus ring) — single-consumer for now, ready to lift when a second toggle appears.
- `tools/dev-dashboard/src/server/version.ts` exporting `VERSION` via an esbuild `define: { __VERSION__ }` that reads `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at bundle time, so the About tab shows the user-installed plugin version instead of `tools/dev-dashboard/package.json`'s internal `0.1.0`.
- Mockups at `.dev/dashboard-detail-ui-enhancements/terminal-config-mockup-v2.html` and the v1 (gitignored) — visual reference for the tabbed panel.

### Internal
- 150 dashboard tests passing (116 prior + 23 preset-resolver cases in the new `terminal-presets.test.ts` + 11 GET/POST round-trip and security cases in `api.test.ts`).
- `ConfigurationPanel.tsx` refactored from a single form into a tabbed shell. All four tab subcomponents (`ScanDirsTab` / `TerminalTab` / `NotificationsTab` / `AboutTab`) live inline per the single-consumer rule. Tab panels mount unconditionally and toggle visibility via the `hidden` attribute, keeping DOM stable across switches.
- `App.tsx` form state for terminal and notifications mirrors the scan-dirs trio (`{draft, saving, saveError}`); response from `POST /api/config` is treated as authoritative for `dashboardConfig`, then the local draft is re-derived from the server's view.
- Per-platform `terminal` payload merge happens server-side in `api.ts` after a fresh `readStoredConfig()`, so two clients editing different platforms never race past each other.

## v1.28.1 - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- `/dev-checkpoint` no longer fails with `Bad control character in string literal` when the checkpoint context contains multi-line markdown. Step 8 now writes the JSON to `.checkpoint-input.json` and passes its path to the CLI instead of piping it through `echo '...'`, which was mangling literal newlines inside string values.

### Changed

- `checkpoint-write` CLI accepts `--input-file <path>` in addition to `--stdin`. Exactly one of the two is required. `--stdin` still works for programmatic callers that can produce escaped JSON reliably.

## v1.28.0 - 2026-04-13

### Smarter checkpoints, faster resumes

Checkpoints and resumes are now powered by deterministic CLI commands instead of LLM-generated markdown. This means your checkpoint files are always format-compatible with the parser — no more drift from hand-edited markdown — and resuming a session takes **one tool call** instead of six.

**What you'll notice:**
- **`/dev-checkpoint`** no longer writes markdown by hand. It composes structured data and pipes it to a CLI that handles formatting, writing, and session-log appending. Your checkpoints are guaranteed compatible with the parser every time.
- **`/dev-checkpoint`** also marks PRD steps as complete using a CLI command (`status-update --step N --marker done`) instead of manual file edits — no risk of accidentally changing other content.
- **`/dev-resume`** loads everything in a single call (`resume-context`). Instead of making 6 separate tool calls and reading the full master plan, it receives a pre-organized context packet with your current phase PRD, session history, and accumulated decisions across all sessions.
- **Session continuity** — each checkpoint automatically archives the previous one to `session-log.md`. When you resume, you see decisions and context from *every* session, not just the most recent one. No more re-typing or hallucinating past decisions.
- **Better error handling** — both skills now explicitly check CLI exit codes. If a command fails, you'll see the error instead of silently continuing with missing data.

### Changed
- `dev-checkpoint` skill — Steps 4, 7-8 delegate to CLI commands. LLM composes *what* to say; CLI handles *how* it's formatted and written.
- `dev-resume` skill — Steps 2-5 collapsed into single `resume-context` call. Step numbering simplified from 0-8 to 0-7.

### Internal
- Added `writeCheckpoint()`, `updateStatus()`, `parseSessionLog()` to `dev-workflow-core`
- Added `checkpoint-write`, `status-update`, `resume-context` CLI commands to `dev-workflow-cli`
- ESLint added to core and CLI build pipelines
- 162 tests passing (105 core + 57 CLI)

## v1.27.2 - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- `gate-check` now always exits 0 on success (uses JSON `atGate` field for status instead of exit code 2). Prevents parallel tool call cancellation when LLM runs `gate-check` alongside other commands.

## v1.27.1 - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- Fixed `gate-check` failing (exit code 2) for features using sub-PRDs instead of `### Phase N:` headers in the master plan.
- Fixed `parseSubPrd` ignoring `**Status**` header field when no Implementation Progress table is present.
- Fixed `parseFeature` not detecting gate status from sub-PRD completion states.

## v1.27.0 - 2026-04-09

### Added

- Extracted shared workflow core (`dev-workflow-core`) from dashboard for unified `.dev/` parsing across all consumers.
- Added agent-first CLI (`dev-workflow-cli`) with four commands: `feature-show`, `progress-summary`, `gate-check`, `checkpoint-read`.
- CLI bundle distributed as self-contained `dev-workflow.cjs` copies inside each skill for portability.
- Added CLI drift protection in pre-commit hook and cross-skill sync checks in test suite.

### Changed

- Migrated dashboard to consume shared `dev-workflow-core` instead of owning parsing logic directly.
- Updated `dev-resume` skill to use CLI for checkpoint/feature loading instead of context-loader agent.
- Updated `dev-checkpoint` skill to use CLI for progress/gate state instead of checkpoint-analyzer agent.
- Updated `dev-plan` skill to verify PRD structure via CLI after creation.
- Added mechanical `gate-check` enforcement to `dev-resume` phase gates.

### Removed

- Removed `context-loader` agent (replaced by CLI in dev-resume).
- Removed `checkpoint-analyzer` agent (replaced by CLI in dev-checkpoint).
- Removed stale `ExitPlanMode` reference from dev-plan.

## v1.26.4 - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Added a Configuration button in the dashboard header so you can reopen scan-folder settings after setup and update which folders dev-dashboard watches.

## v1.26.3 - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Added explicit first-run scan-directory onboarding to dev-dashboard, so new installs now ask which folders to scan instead of silently assuming `~/code`.

### Changed

- Added a Configuration button to the dashboard header so you can reopen scan-folder settings at any time after setup.
- Changed fresh dev-dashboard setup to start in an onboarding state while leaving existing configured installs untouched.
- Updated the dashboard docs and release metadata to match the new first-run scan-root flow.

## v1.26.2 - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Added compact and detailed view modes to the activity report.
- Added a worked-days metric to report features, with fallback date logic when `Created` is missing.
- Added a hover-only `Go to feature` action in the activity report that opens the matching feature in project view.
- Added compact and detailed project-list controls near search in the projects view.

### Changed

- Sorted activity report projects with active or stale work first, then other non-archived projects, then archived-only projects.
- Persisted the selected report date preset so the active period chip survives reloads and view switches.
- Changed the projects-view compact/detailed control to collapse or expand project cards globally instead of changing feature row content.
- Moved the report compact/detailed control next to the project selector and switched it to icon buttons with tooltips.
- Synced the dashboard build stamp to the marketplace version.

### Fixed

- Fixed activity report completion stats for fully completed features.
- Fixed missing worked-days labels for features that have progress but no explicit `Created` metadata.

## v1.26.1 - 2026-03-28

### Changed

- Bumped the marketplace version to `1.26.1`.

### Fixed

- Fixed activity report completion stats.
- Added a dashboard build/version stamp.
- Updated the dashboard to read its version from `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` instead of `tools/dev-dashboard/package.json`.

## v1.37.0 - 2026-06-22

### Security

- The bundled `dev-workflow.cjs` CLI now ships with **zero dynamic-code-execution primitives**. A guarded esbuild transform strips `gray-matter`'s `eval()` (its optional JS-frontmatter engine) and `js-yaml`'s `new Function()` (the `!!js/function` type) from every shipped copy at build time — both were dead code under the YAML-only `safeLoad` path the parser actually uses, so PRD parsing is byte-for-byte unchanged. This removes the remote-code-execution surface that drove the `/dev-wiki` security rating and the `usesEval` dependency alerts on the bundle. The transform is guarded — the build fails if a dependency bump relocates either pattern, so a primitive can never silently re-ship — and a bundle smoke test that runs the real `.cjs` (not the TS source, which never loads the shipped artifact) is now part of the test suite.
- `/dev-review` now treats every PRD, checkpoint, and diff it ingests as **untrusted data, not instructions**. The `feature-reporter` subagent receives that markdown wrapped in XML-like boundary markers (`<prd-content>`, `<checkpoint-content>`, `<diff>`), behind a foregrounded mandatory user-review gate, with its `Edit` capability scoped to the feature's own `.dev/` docs — mirroring the structure that keeps `/dev-checkpoint` from being flagged for the same prompt-injection category. The boundary is enforced in both the skill and the bundled `feature-reporter` agent.
- `/dev-wiki`'s filesystem writes are now documented as bounded to `~/.dev-wiki`, covering both the CLI generator and the dashboard write site.

### Changed

- The dev-dashboard server now binds to **`127.0.0.1` (loopback) by default** instead of `0.0.0.0`. LAN exposure is opt-in via `--lan`, `--host <addr>`, or `DEV_DASHBOARD_HOST` (precedence: CLI > env > stored > default), and a LAN bind logs a warning at startup. The bind host is intentionally **not** settable through the HTTP API, so a web request can never flip the server to a LAN-exposed address. The dashboard port file is now read by a committed `read-port.cjs` (config path passed as an argv, not string-interpolated) instead of an inline `node -e`, removing the last dynamic-code surface from the launch path.

### Removed

- The dev-dashboard `~/.local/bin` shim-install chain — `install.sh`, `check-install.sh`, and the runtime `chmod`/`node -e` they relied on. The `/dev-dashboard` skill now launches `start.sh`/`stop.sh` directly by absolute path, and skills already invoke the bundled CLI by absolute path, so the shims had no load-bearing consumer. Removing the install capability outright (rather than hardening it) clears the `COMMAND_EXECUTION` driver behind the dev-dashboard rating. Existing user-installed shims keep working but are now unmanaged.

## v1.36.0 - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- `/dev-review` now produces a **concise, scannable** report — a header plus three sections (a deviations table, future-affecting constraints as bullets, and an untested-areas table), each row carrying a verdict chip (✅ / 🔶 / 🔴) and a `file:line` — instead of the previous four-section prose report. It is built for the architect who knows the overall picture and triages in under a minute. The `feature-reporter` agent still explores the codebase deeply (checkboxes are not trusted) and is now explicitly guarded against over-claiming — scope a "unused" claim precisely, verify before characterizing — but the deliverable is tables and bullets, not a wall of prose.
- After presenting, `/dev-review` offers to apply the documentation corrections it surfaces (the report's "Your call" column) back to the feature's PRD and checkpoint, per item on explicit confirmation. The skill's scope widened from review-only to report-plus-doc-write-backs: it may now `Edit` **only** the feature's own `.dev/<feature>/` PRD and checkpoint markdown, and never code.

### Removed

- The `/dev-review` "save to `.dev/<feature>/review.md`" step. The saved report was read by nothing — not the dashboard, the wiki, or any skill — so it produced a parallel artifact with no downstream consumer. Its durable value (the doc corrections) now flows into the PRD and checkpoint that future sessions actually read.

## v1.35.0 - 2026-06-12

### Added

- `/dev-review` skill: generates an architect-readable PRD-vs-implementation alignment report. It spawns a fresh `feature-reporter` subagent that explores the codebase (rather than trusting PRD checkboxes) and reports in four sections — deviations first, then what was built and how it works, the limits imposed by architectural constraints, and what remains untested. The audience is the architect who designed the feature but has not read the code. It is review-only: it never edits project files, never emits verdict tags, and writes `.dev/<feature>/review.md` only after explicit confirmation. Use it when a feature's implementation is finished (or nearly), before final testing. `/dev-resume` now suggests it at the final phase gate.

### Changed

- `/dev-checkpoint` now asks and executes the branch/worktree and commit decisions **before** updating PRD markers and writing the checkpoint, instead of after. Previously a branch created at the end of the skill landed after the checkpoint was written, so the next `/dev-resume` saw a branch mismatch and reported `drifted`. With commit-first ordering the saved checkpoint records the branch and commit the session actually ends on; the marker edits and checkpoint files written after the commit are honestly recorded as `uncommittedChanges: true` and swept into the next session's commit. The worktree sub-flow retargets all paths into the worktree and defers the "restart in the worktree" instruction to the final summary, so the checkpoint is written before the user is told to leave. Declining the commit no longer ends the skill early — the checkpoint is still saved.

### Removed

- The `dev-judge`, `dev-afk`, and `dev-quiz` skills, along with all their supporting machinery: the `phase-reviewer` agent, verdict parsing in `dev-workflow-core` (`parseVerdict`/`parseFeedback`/the `Verdict` type and fixtures), AFK-runnability classification (`afk-runnable.ts`), and the `--afk` flag plus `afk` JSON field on the `dev-workflow list` command. These were built around ralph-loop-driven unattended automation and have not been used in real projects; Claude Code's native `/loop` supersedes `dev-afk`, and `dev-judge`/`dev-quiz` mainly existed as its quality gates. The `list` command itself remains as a general feature-listing tool.

## v1.34.0 - 2026-06-03

### Changed

- User-local command shims (`dev-workflow`, `dev-dashboard`, `dev-dashboard-stop`) installed by the dev-dashboard skill are now **self-resolving across versions**. Previously each shim baked the absolute path of the marketplace-cache version it was installed from (`…/cache/dev-workflow/dev-workflow/<version>/…`), so every `/plugin update` left the shims pointing at the old, now-superseded bundle until the install script happened to be re-run — the standalone `dev-workflow` command and any shim-launched dashboard silently kept running stale code. For a cached install the shim now bakes only the version-stripped root and resolves the newest installed version at runtime, so a `/plugin update` is picked up with zero reinstall. The body is version-independent, so `check-install.sh` no longer reports a freshly-updated install as `stale`, and an older version-pinned shim upgrades cleanly to the self-resolving form on the next install run. Contributor-mode shims (pointing at the repo's `plugins/` tree) are unchanged.

### Added

- `dev-dashboard --restart` (and `start.sh --restart`): stop any running bundled dashboard server — across cache versions — then start a fresh one from the newest bundle, in a single command. Intended for use right after a `/plugin update` to reload the long-lived server, which a code update alone can't refresh.
- Regression coverage: the install suite builds a fake multi-version marketplace cache and asserts a shim installed from an older version runs the newest at runtime and tracks a newly-appeared version with no reinstall; the stop suite statically asserts the `--restart` wiring without spawning or killing a server (so it can't disturb a developer's real dashboard).

## v1.33.0 - 2026-06-03

### Added

- The status-marker parser now recognizes `⏹️` (emoji) and the words `MERGED`, `CLOSED`, and `DEFERRED` as resolved markers, alongside the existing `✅`/`⏭️`/`⛔`/`DONE`/`SHIPPED`/`DROPPED`/`SKIPPED` set. These show up naturally when an effort is wrapped up — a phase noted `✅ MERGED end-to-end`, an investigation `✅ CLOSED`, a track `⏹️ DEFERRED` to a future PRD — but were previously invisible to the parser, so a feature that was genuinely done still read as `gate`/`in-progress` and never surfaced the dashboard's Archive action. The new tokens are added everywhere markers are counted: numbered and bullet step counters, the sub-PRD Implementation Progress table, the leading prose phase-marker line, and the `**Status**:` header fallback. Deferred work is treated as terminal (resolved), consistent with how `⛔ Dropped` and `⏭️ Skipped` already behaved.
- `normalizeEmoji()` maps the `:stop_button:` shortcode to `⏹️`.
- Test fixtures extended to cover the new markers: `master-with-prose-status/` gains `✅ MERGED`, `⏹️ DEFERRED`, and `✅ CLOSED` phases, and `subprd-mixed-steps/` gains a `⏹️ Deferred` step row.

## v1.32.1 - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- Sub-PRD step counting in `dev-workflow-core` no longer silently drops steps whose row format deviates from `| **N** |`. The Implementation Progress row regex in `parseSubPrd()` previously required a purely-numeric, bold step identifier, so any track-lettered or dotted ID (`3A`, `3A.1`, `3G`) and any non-bold ID (`| 1 |`) was skipped — undercounting totals and, worse, hiding completed work (e.g. a shipped `✅` step labelled `3G` reported the whole sub-PRD as `0/3 Not Started`). The regex now accepts an optionally-bold identifier that merely starts with a digit (`\*{0,2}(\d[\w.]*)\*{0,2}`), so the `| Step |` header and `|---|` separator rows still never match. `SubPrdStep.number` changed from `number` to `string` to preserve IDs faithfully (`"3A.1"`), and step descriptions are now captured in the same pass instead of a second whole-document scan.
- The `⛔` (Dropped) marker is now recognized everywhere step markers are counted — both the sub-PRD table and the phase-level numbered/bullet step counters — and counts as resolved (like `⏭️` Skipped), so a sub-PRD with a dropped track can still reach `complete` instead of being stuck `in-progress`.
- New regression fixture `subprd-mixed-steps/` exercises track-lettered, plain non-bold, and `⛔`-dropped rows in one table.

## v1.32.0 - 2026-05-24

### Added
- Cross-project full-text search across core, CLI, server API, and dashboard UI. Type natural queries like "forge migration" in the dashboard search box to instantly find matching features across all projects with status badges, progress bars, and contextual snippets.
- `searchFeatures()` pure function in `dev-workflow-core` with multi-word AND matching across name, summary, nextAction, branch, and currentPhase fields.
- `search` CLI command with `--query`, `--project`, `--status`, `--scan`, `--max`, `--json` flags.
- `GET /api/search?q=&project=&status=` server route backed by in-memory project state.
- SearchPanel overlay component with keyboard navigation, term highlighting, loading skeletons, and results grouped by project.

## v1.31.0 - 2026-05-23

### Added
- Wiki generator: cross-project markdown wiki from `.dev/` and `.dev-archive/` PRDs, auto-generated by the dashboard server and available via `dev-workflow wiki-index --generate` CLI. Browsable in Obsidian, queryable by skills as lightweight RAG.
- Dashboard server integration: `wikiDir` config option, debounced wiki regeneration on all state changes, `GET /api/wiki` endpoint serving the wiki index as JSON.
- `wiki-index` CLI command with `--json`, `--generate`, `--scan`, `--out` flags.
- `/dev-wiki` skill for on-demand wiki generation and Obsidian vault setup.
- `/dev-plan` now consults `~/.dev-wiki/index.md` for cross-project prior art before researching (skips silently when absent).
- `/dev-resume` optionally references `~/.dev-wiki/index.md` for cross-project context when reading key files.

## v1.30.4 - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- `dev-dashboard-stop` now stops a dashboard server still running from a prior version's cache path after `/plugin update`. The `find_pids()` helper in `plugins/dev-workflow/skills/dev-dashboard/scripts/stop.sh` previously matched processes against the current install's absolute `SERVER_ENTRY` path, so a server launched from `…/cache/dev-workflow/dev-workflow/1.30.3/skills/dev-dashboard/dashboard/server/index.cjs` was invisible to a `dev-dashboard-stop` invoked from the 1.30.4 cache — the stale process kept the port and the next `dev-dashboard` start either failed or silently picked a different port. The helper now matches on `SERVER_ENTRY_PATTERN="/skills/dev-dashboard/dashboard/server/index.cjs"`, the stable path suffix shared by every cached or contributor-mode install. This is the same class of cross-version staleness fixed for the workflow CLI shim in v1.30.3. New `tests/test-dev-dashboard-stop.sh` regression test spawns a fake bundled server at a cross-version-shaped path and asserts the pattern matches it via `pgrep -f`; the test deliberately does not invoke `stop.sh` end-to-end so it never disturbs a developer's real running dashboard.

## v1.30.3 - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- `/dev-dashboard`'s install script now refreshes the `dev-workflow` CLI shim across plugin upgrades instead of marking it as `conflict`. `is_managed_workflow_shim()` (in `plugins/dev-workflow/skills/dev-dashboard/scripts/install.sh`) and its companion `workflow_is_managed()` (in `check-install.sh`) previously only recognized a shim as theirs if it pointed at the *current* version's exact target path or the contributor-mode `/plugins/dev-workflow/bin/dev-workflow.cjs`. Any shim written by a prior version (e.g. one pointing at `…/cache/dev-workflow/dev-workflow/1.29.0/bin/dev-workflow.cjs`) was treated as foreign, so terminal calls to `dev-workflow` stayed pinned to the old bundle even after `/plugin update` brought down the new version. The matchers now also accept any shim whose body contains both `/cache/dev-workflow/dev-workflow/` and `/bin/dev-workflow.cjs`, so the installer rewrites it to the current target on the next run. New regression test in `tests/test-dev-dashboard-install.sh` locks in the cross-version refresh path while keeping the existing "unrelated command" conflict guard intact.

## v1.30.2 - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- `/dev-dashboard` and the CLI now read phase status correctly for master + sub-PRD plans. When a phase in `00-master-plan.md` delegates to a sub-PRD (no enumerated steps in the body — just a `See [sub-prd]` pointer and a status sentence like `✅ **DONE** (date): …`), the parser previously read the phase as `not-started`, so `currentPhase` could stay stuck on a phase that had actually shipped across many sessions. `extractPhases` in `tools/dev-workflow-core/src/parser.ts` now scans the first content line under each phase heading (skipping blanks and an optional `See [link]` pointer) for an emoji status marker plus one of DONE / SHIPPED / COMPLETE / DROPPED / SKIPPED / NOT STARTED / TODO / IN PROGRESS. Unrelated emoji deeper in the section don't trigger the fallback. New parser fixture `master-with-prose-status` covers the five common marker shapes.

## v1.30.1 - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- `/dev-dashboard` no longer goes stale when chokidar misses a filesystem event. The watcher in `tools/dev-dashboard/src/server/watcher.ts` reacts to `add`/`change`/`unlink` events from chokidar v4, which on macOS uses Node's native `fs.watch` (no fsevents) and can silently drop events — especially across sleep/wake on long-running processes. New features added to `.dev/` after the dashboard started could remain invisible until restart. A 5-minute periodic rescan in `tools/dev-dashboard/src/server/index.ts` now calls `scanProjects()` against the current scan dirs, diffs the result against the in-memory state, and broadcasts `full_refresh` only when something changed (no needless client re-renders on idle ticks).

## v1.30.0 - 2026-05-09

### Dashboard detail panel polish

The feature detail panel in `/dev-dashboard` gets three coordinated upgrades that change how you read your in-flight work.

**What you'll notice:**
- **Markdown rendering for NEXT ACTION, DECISIONS, and BLOCKERS.** Headings render as small uppercase sky-tinted labels, numbered lists get muted Plex Mono numerals, and inline `code` shows up as cyan terminal chips — your checkpoint markdown finally renders the way you wrote it instead of as one wall of plain text.
- **Open-externally toolbar.** Three ghost icon buttons in the new panel header open the feature's `checkpoint.md` in the OS default app, reveal it in Finder/Explorer, or open a terminal at the feature directory. macOS and Linux paths are clean; Windows terminal mode is best-effort (`wt.exe` if present). The Archive/Restore button moves to the far right of the same header bar.
- **Session History collapsible.** A new section at the bottom of the panel surfaces parsed `session-log.md` entries — newest first, sky border + LATEST pill on the freshest entry, slate on older ones. Each entry has its own collapse state; the top two newest start expanded.

### Added
- `POST /api/projects/:project/features/:feature/open` route in the dashboard server. Takes a mode enum (`open` | `reveal` | `terminal`) and dispatches per-platform launchers via `execFile` with discrete arg arrays — the client never sends a path, so there's no shell-injection surface.
- `marked@^15` for client-side markdown rendering. Scoped CSS lives under `@layer components` in `styles.css` so Tailwind utilities still win the cascade if you need to override on a specific instance.
- `sessionLog` field on `FeatureDetail` API responses (populated array when `session-log.md` exists, `null` when absent).
- `parseSessionLog` and `SessionLogEntry` re-exported from the dashboard server's parser.
- Mockup at `.dev/dashboard-detail-ui-enhancements/mockup.html` (gitignored) — visual reference for the redesigned panel.

### Fixed
- Features with a complete master plan and a pending sub-PRD no longer show as `complete`. The parser was only consulting sub-PRD step counts when the master plan had zero inline steps, so any sub-PRD added as an extension after the original feature shipped was invisible to the dashboard, the CLI, and `/dev-afk`. `parseFeature` now adds sub-PRD step counts to the master plan total whenever the master plan is fully complete, and `currentPhase` falls back to the first pending sub-PRD phase so AFK can pick up the work. The in-progress case is unchanged — sub-PRDs there typically describe master-plan work in detail and combining the two would double-count.

### Internal
- 116 dashboard tests passing (108 prior + 6 markdown helpers + 7 open route + 2 sessionLog API).
- New `tools/dev-dashboard/src/client/lib/markdown.ts` with `render()` / `renderInline()` helpers, configured once at module load with `{ gfm: true, breaks: false }`. Trust boundary documented inline (local PRD content; layer DOMPurify here if the surface ever extends to remote content).
- The existing watcher already picks up `session-log.md` changes — no extension needed.
- New parser fixture `master-complete-subprd-pending` covering the additive aggregation case (4 master plan steps done + 3 sub-PRD steps pending → 4/7, status `active`).

### Configurable terminal + tabbed Configuration panel

The Configuration panel that opened from the gear icon used to be a single scan-dirs form. It now hosts four tabs, and the previously-hardcoded terminal that opens from the feature toolbar's terminal icon is finally user-pickable.

**What you'll notice:**
- **Pick your terminal app.** Configuration → Terminal lets you choose from a preset dropdown (Terminal, iTerm2, WezTerm, Ghostty, Kitty, Alacritty, Warp on macOS; gnome-terminal, Konsole, WezTerm, Kitty, Alacritty on Linux; Windows Terminal, WezTerm, Alacritty on Windows). Custom… reveals discrete Command + Arguments fields with `{{cwd}}` substitution at launch. The setting persists per platform, so a synced `~/.config/dev-dashboard/config.json` keeps each OS's preference intact when you save from another.
- **Tabbed Configuration.** Scan directories / Terminal / Notifications / About, with proper WAI-ARIA `role="tablist"` semantics and arrow-key navigation (Left/Right/Home/End cycle focus and activate).
- **Notifications toggle.** A new `role="switch"` control persists your preference alongside the rest of the dashboard config. The runtime daemon hasn't shipped yet — the toggle just remembers the choice for when it does.
- **About tab.** Read-only summary of the plugin version, config file path, platform, and counts of watched projects and features. Useful when reporting issues or sanity-checking what the dashboard is actually scanning.

### Added
- `terminal: { darwin?, linux?, win32? }` field on `DashboardConfig`, with each entry either a preset id string or `{ cmd, args[] }` for custom mode. POSTs merge per-platform so a save from one OS doesn't clobber the others; sending `null` for a platform clears that entry.
- `DashboardConfigResponse` wrapper on `GET` and `POST /api/config` carrying `platform` / `version` / `configPath` alongside the persisted config — the client About tab and the platform-aware Terminal tab fetch in one round-trip.
- `tools/dev-dashboard/src/server/terminal-presets.ts` with `KNOWN_TERMINALS` registry and a pure `resolveTerminalCommand()` resolver. Each preset carries a `(cwd) => { cmd, args }` recipe; the open-route's terminal mode consults the user's setting first and falls back to `buildOpenCommand` when nothing's configured. Discrete-args invariant preserved end-to-end — no shell parsing, no `.split(' ')`, never an `exec()` call.
- `tools/dev-dashboard/src/client/terminal-presets.ts` with the matching label table plus form-state helpers (`TerminalDraft`, `deriveTerminalDraft`, `draftToSetting`, `isTerminalDraftDirty`).
- Inline `Toggle` primitive in `ConfigurationPanel.tsx` (`<button role="switch">` with `aria-checked` + `aria-labelledby`, native Space/Enter, focus ring) — single-consumer for now, ready to lift when a second toggle appears.
- `tools/dev-dashboard/src/server/version.ts` exporting `VERSION` via an esbuild `define: { __VERSION__ }` that reads `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at bundle time, so the About tab shows the user-installed plugin version instead of `tools/dev-dashboard/package.json`'s internal `0.1.0`.
- Mockups at `.dev/dashboard-detail-ui-enhancements/terminal-config-mockup-v2.html` and the v1 (gitignored) — visual reference for the tabbed panel.

### Internal
- 150 dashboard tests passing (116 prior + 23 preset-resolver cases in the new `terminal-presets.test.ts` + 11 GET/POST round-trip and security cases in `api.test.ts`).
- `ConfigurationPanel.tsx` refactored from a single form into a tabbed shell. All four tab subcomponents (`ScanDirsTab` / `TerminalTab` / `NotificationsTab` / `AboutTab`) live inline per the single-consumer rule. Tab panels mount unconditionally and toggle visibility via the `hidden` attribute, keeping DOM stable across switches.
- `App.tsx` form state for terminal and notifications mirrors the scan-dirs trio (`{draft, saving, saveError}`); response from `POST /api/config` is treated as authoritative for `dashboardConfig`, then the local draft is re-derived from the server's view.
- Per-platform `terminal` payload merge happens server-side in `api.ts` after a fresh `readStoredConfig()`, so two clients editing different platforms never race past each other.

## v1.29.0 - 2026-05-07

### Plan and phase review skills, AFK preflight CLI, AFK loop via ralph-loop

Two new review skills (`dev-quiz` for plans, `dev-judge` for phases), a `dev-workflow list` terminal preflight that mirrors the dashboard, and a `/dev-afk` skill that drives unattended phase implementation through the [`ralph-loop`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official) plugin from the official Claude marketplace.

**What you'll notice:**
- New `/dev-quiz` skill grills a `.dev/<feature>/` plan against a 7-criterion rubric (structural plus substantive: load-bearing assumptions, failure modes, counterfactual sanity) and emits `<verdict>pass|revise|escalate</verdict>` with concrete feedback.
- New `/dev-judge` skill does the same for a completed phase's diff, judging it against the sub-PRD's acceptance criteria. Ships a `phase-reviewer` agent.
- New `dev-workflow list` CLI command lists features grouped by project and flags which are AFK-runnable (`--afk`), with JSON output (`--json`), scan-dir overrides (`--scan`), and status filters.
- New `/dev-afk` skill loops a feature's pending phases unattended by composing `/dev-resume` → implement → `/dev-checkpoint` → `/dev-judge` and handing the loop to `/ralph-loop`. Best fit is 1-3 phase features; longer features hit ralph's session-context limits.
- `/dev-dashboard` first-run install now manages three commands instead of two: `dev-dashboard`, `dev-dashboard-stop`, and `dev-workflow`. An unrelated pre-existing `dev-workflow` on `PATH` is reported as a conflict and dashboard install still completes; the dashboard is never blocked by a workflow-CLI conflict.

### Added

- `dev-workflow list` CLI command with `--scan`, `--afk`, `--all`, `--project`, `--status`, `--json`, and `--dir` flags. Reads scan dirs from `~/.config/dev-dashboard/config.json` when `--scan` is omitted.
- `getAfkRunnableInfo` classifier in `dev-workflow-core` — pure helper that consumes a `Feature` shape and returns a runnable / not-runnable verdict with a reason string. Shared between the CLI and any future runner.
- `parseVerdict` and `parseFeedback` helpers in `dev-workflow-core`. Verdict parsing is first-class, not stdout-grep.
- Three skills under `plugins/dev-workflow/skills/`: `dev-quiz/` (plan rubric + REVIEW-ONLY guard), `dev-judge/` (phase rubric + `phase-reviewer` agent), and `dev-afk/` (ralph-loop driver + prompt template).

### Changed

- `extractXmlTag` in `dev-workflow-core` returns the last match instead of the first, so quoted example `<verdict>` blocks in SKILL.md or rubric.md cannot contaminate verdict parsing. Single-occurrence checkpoint tags (`<context>`, `<decisions>`, etc.) are unaffected.
- `/dev-dashboard` first-run install contract was extended to cover the new `dev-workflow` shim, with new `workflow_status` (`installed | missing | stale | conflict`), `workflow_shim`, `workflow_target`, and `workflow_conflict` lines from `check-install.sh`. Dashboard install is decoupled from workflow-CLI install state so the dashboard always launches.

### Fixed

- `/dev-afk` prompt template stripped of backticks (and any shell-active characters). The composed prompt is interpolated into ralph-loop's `$ARGUMENTS` and re-evaluated by zsh in a double-quoted context downstream — backticks were silently triggering command substitution and replacing every `/dev-resume`, `/dev-judge`, and feature-name reference with empty strings, so the loop would activate with a broken prompt. Added a regression check in `tests/test-scripts.sh` that asserts the prompt body has no `` ` ``, `$`, or `!`.

## v1.28.1 - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- `/dev-checkpoint` no longer fails with `Bad control character in string literal` when the checkpoint context contains multi-line markdown. Step 8 now writes the JSON to `.checkpoint-input.json` and passes its path to the CLI instead of piping it through `echo '...'`, which was mangling literal newlines inside string values.

### Changed

- `checkpoint-write` CLI accepts `--input-file <path>` in addition to `--stdin`. Exactly one of the two is required. `--stdin` still works for programmatic callers that can produce escaped JSON reliably.

## v1.28.0 - 2026-04-13

### Smarter checkpoints, faster resumes

Checkpoints and resumes are now powered by deterministic CLI commands instead of LLM-generated markdown. This means your checkpoint files are always format-compatible with the parser — no more drift from hand-edited markdown — and resuming a session takes **one tool call** instead of six.

**What you'll notice:**
- **`/dev-checkpoint`** no longer writes markdown by hand. It composes structured data and pipes it to a CLI that handles formatting, writing, and session-log appending. Your checkpoints are guaranteed compatible with the parser every time.
- **`/dev-checkpoint`** also marks PRD steps as complete using a CLI command (`status-update --step N --marker done`) instead of manual file edits — no risk of accidentally changing other content.
- **`/dev-resume`** loads everything in a single call (`resume-context`). Instead of making 6 separate tool calls and reading the full master plan, it receives a pre-organized context packet with your current phase PRD, session history, and accumulated decisions across all sessions.
- **Session continuity** — each checkpoint automatically archives the previous one to `session-log.md`. When you resume, you see decisions and context from *every* session, not just the most recent one. No more re-typing or hallucinating past decisions.
- **Better error handling** — both skills now explicitly check CLI exit codes. If a command fails, you'll see the error instead of silently continuing with missing data.

### Changed
- `dev-checkpoint` skill — Steps 4, 7-8 delegate to CLI commands. LLM composes *what* to say; CLI handles *how* it's formatted and written.
- `dev-resume` skill — Steps 2-5 collapsed into single `resume-context` call. Step numbering simplified from 0-8 to 0-7.

### Internal
- Added `writeCheckpoint()`, `updateStatus()`, `parseSessionLog()` to `dev-workflow-core`
- Added `checkpoint-write`, `status-update`, `resume-context` CLI commands to `dev-workflow-cli`
- ESLint added to core and CLI build pipelines
- 162 tests passing (105 core + 57 CLI)

## v1.27.2 - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- `gate-check` now always exits 0 on success (uses JSON `atGate` field for status instead of exit code 2). Prevents parallel tool call cancellation when LLM runs `gate-check` alongside other commands.

## v1.27.1 - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- Fixed `gate-check` failing (exit code 2) for features using sub-PRDs instead of `### Phase N:` headers in the master plan.
- Fixed `parseSubPrd` ignoring `**Status**` header field when no Implementation Progress table is present.
- Fixed `parseFeature` not detecting gate status from sub-PRD completion states.

## v1.27.0 - 2026-04-09

### Added

- Extracted shared workflow core (`dev-workflow-core`) from dashboard for unified `.dev/` parsing across all consumers.
- Added agent-first CLI (`dev-workflow-cli`) with four commands: `feature-show`, `progress-summary`, `gate-check`, `checkpoint-read`.
- CLI bundle distributed as self-contained `dev-workflow.cjs` copies inside each skill for portability.
- Added CLI drift protection in pre-commit hook and cross-skill sync checks in test suite.

### Changed

- Migrated dashboard to consume shared `dev-workflow-core` instead of owning parsing logic directly.
- Updated `dev-resume` skill to use CLI for checkpoint/feature loading instead of context-loader agent.
- Updated `dev-checkpoint` skill to use CLI for progress/gate state instead of checkpoint-analyzer agent.
- Updated `dev-plan` skill to verify PRD structure via CLI after creation.
- Added mechanical `gate-check` enforcement to `dev-resume` phase gates.

### Removed

- Removed `context-loader` agent (replaced by CLI in dev-resume).
- Removed `checkpoint-analyzer` agent (replaced by CLI in dev-checkpoint).
- Removed stale `ExitPlanMode` reference from dev-plan.

## v1.26.4 - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Added a Configuration button in the dashboard header so you can reopen scan-folder settings after setup and update which folders dev-dashboard watches.

## v1.26.3 - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Added explicit first-run scan-directory onboarding to dev-dashboard, so new installs now ask which folders to scan instead of silently assuming `~/code`.

### Changed

- Changed fresh dev-dashboard setup to start in an onboarding state while leaving existing configured installs untouched.
- Updated the dashboard docs and release metadata to match the new first-run scan-root flow.

## v1.26.2 - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Added compact and detailed view modes to the activity report.
- Added a worked-days metric to report features, with fallback date logic when `Created` is missing.
- Added a hover-only `Go to feature` action in the activity report that opens the matching feature in project view.
- Added compact and detailed project-list controls near search in the projects view.

### Changed

- Sorted activity report projects with active or stale work first, then other non-archived projects, then archived-only projects.
- Persisted the selected report date preset so the active period chip survives reloads and view switches.
- Changed the projects-view compact/detailed control to collapse or expand project cards globally instead of changing feature row content.
- Moved the report compact/detailed control next to the project selector and switched it to icon buttons with tooltips.
- Synced the dashboard build stamp to the marketplace version.

### Fixed

- Fixed activity report completion stats for fully completed features.
- Fixed missing worked-days labels for features that have progress but no explicit `Created` metadata.

## v1.26.1 - 2026-03-28

### Changed

- Bumped the marketplace version to `1.26.1`.

### Fixed

- Fixed activity report completion stats.
- Added a dashboard build/version stamp.
- Updated the dashboard to read its version from `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` instead of `tools/dev-dashboard/package.json`.

## v1.26.0 - 2026-03-27

## Changes

- **Remove dev-status and dev-board skills** — fully replaced by the live dev-dashboard
- **Make dashboard AI-tool-agnostic** — remove all Claude-specific copy-paste commands (Resume, Plan, Board); dashboard now works with any tool that reads/writes `.dev/` PRDs (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.)
- **Server-side Archive/Restore** — archive and restore actions now execute directly via API with a confirmation dialog, instead of copying shell commands to clipboard
- **New API endpoints** — `POST /api/projects/:project/features/:feature/archive` and `/restore`
- **Updated README** — removed dev-status/dev-board docs, documented dashboard actions

## v1.25.0 - 2026-03-27

Add date-range activity report view to dev-dashboard

## v1.24.0 - 2026-03-26

### Fix

- **Detail panel stale cache**: Fixed a bug where the feature detail panel showed stale data after collapsing and re-expanding. The `useFeatureDetail` hook's module-level cache survived unmount/remount cycles, but the invalidation signal tracking reset on remount, causing the hook to skip refetching.

## v1.23.0 - 2026-03-26

### Dashboard Navigation UX

- **Clickable title**: "Dev Dashboard" heading returns to all-projects view when a project is selected
- **Breadcrumb subtitle**: Shows "All Projects > projectname" navigation path when viewing a single project
- **URL hash navigation**: Project selection synced to URL (`#project=name`) — enables browser back/forward and PWA swipe-back gesture
- **Escape key shortcut**: Press Escape to return to all-projects view
- **Bug fix**: Project selection restored from localStorage/URL was silently cleared on page load because the cleanup effect fired before WebSocket data arrived

## v1.22.0 - 2026-03-26

### PWA support & connection overlay

- **PWA manifest** — installable as a standalone app on desktop/mobile
- **Service worker** — offline fallback page when server is down, with `updateViaCache:none` so dashboard updates are picked up immediately
- **ConnectionOverlay** — full-screen overlay with auto-reconnect indicator when the server disconnects
- **Offline page** — branded fallback with health-check polling that auto-redirects when the server comes back

## v1.21.0 - 2026-03-25

### Fix: Dashboard now watches .dev-archive for live updates

Previously, moving a feature from `.dev/` to `.dev-archive/` while the dashboard was running would cause it to disappear entirely — the watcher saw the removal but never detected the addition to the archive directory. The watcher now monitors both `.dev/` and `.dev-archive/` directories, so archived features appear immediately without needing a dashboard restart.

Also includes the v1.20.0 fix for numbered checkbox step counting (`1. [x]`, `` 1. \`[x]\` ``).

## v1.20.0 - 2026-03-25

### Fix: Dashboard progress for numbered checkbox steps

The dashboard parser now correctly counts numbered checkbox steps (`1. [x]` and `` 1. `[x]` ``), which were previously invisible to the parser. PRDs using this format (e.g. oliocharts security-fix) would show 0/N progress instead of the actual completion count.

## v1.19.0 - 2026-03-25

Support **Status** `[x]`/`[ ]` markers in dashboard parser.

Phases using `- **Status**: \`[x]\` done` instead of emoji markers were not recognized as complete, causing 0% progress on finished features. The parser now falls back to checking for a `**Status**` field when no step-level or title-level markers are found.

## v1.18.0 - 2026-03-25

### .dev-archive support in dev-dashboard

Archived features (from `.dev-archive/` directories) are now surfaced in the dashboard with clean separation from active work.

**New features:**
- Scanner discovers `.dev-archive/` features and marks them with `'archived'` status
- "Archived" filter pill for explicit access; "All" filter excludes archived
- Collapsible archive divider in project cards separates archived from active features
- Archive-only projects grouped under collapsible "Archived Projects" section in both the main view and sidebar
- "Restore" action button copies `mv` command to clipboard
- Feature detail panel resolves paths correctly for archived features

**Bug fixes:**
- Progress fallback for features that track work in sub-PRDs or phase-level markers instead of inline steps (no more 0/0 when sub-PRDs show 17/17 complete)

**UI polish:**
- Archived features render with muted opacity and slate-toned badges
- Gradient bars and feature counts exclude archived from active metrics
- Archived counts shown in project headers and sidebar

## v1.17.0 - 2026-03-25

## Changes

- Treat 0% progress with no checkpoint as stale instead of active
- Add gate status support to dev-board template and agents
- Make header stats and filter counts reflect project/status selection
- SessionBar reflects active status filter with per-status colored chips
- Stale color changed from amber to red across dashboard and board
- Side panel always shows status color bar (selection uses background highlight)
- Collapsible side panel and session bar with localStorage persistence
- Right-side status gradient bar on project cards for quick scanning
- Port visual changes to dev-board template (stale=red, gate status, status bars)
- Fix pre-push hook to enforce version bumps on main pushes

## v1.16.0 — Dashboard UI improvements & ESLint - 2026-03-25

## Changes

- **Wider layout** — Content area expanded from 1024px to 1280px in both dev-dashboard and dev-board, reducing empty gutters on wide screens
- **3-column grid** — Board overview uses 3 columns on xl screens
- **Larger fonts** — Base font size bumped to 18px across both views, pixel-based sizes scaled proportionally
- **Clearer rail selection** — Selected items now use a white left border + blue tint background instead of the barely-visible dark shade
- **Removed notifications** — Stripped the unused notification bell button and its hook
- **WebSocket dev proxy fix** — Client now connects to `/ws` path so Vite properly proxies to the backend in dev mode
- **ESLint + Prettier** — Added typescript-eslint and Prettier for the dashboard, integrated into pre-commit hook
- **Code cleanup** — Fixed unused imports/vars, removed dead `useNotifications.ts`, formatted all source files

## v1.15.0 — Config hot-reload - 2026-03-24

Config file changes are now picked up at runtime — no server restart needed.

### Added
- Hot-reload of `~/.config/dev-dashboard/config.json` — changing `scanDirs` triggers an automatic rescan and pushes updates to all connected browsers
- 5 tests for config watcher (change detection, CLI override precedence, invalid JSON handling, consecutive changes)
- README documentation for dashboard configuration and terminal shell functions

### Changed
- Total test count: 80 (was 75)

## v1.14.0 — Cross-project dev dashboard - 2026-03-24

Cross-project web dashboard that scans configured code directories for `.dev/` folders and shows live feature status in the browser.

### Added
- `/dev-dashboard` skill — launches a local web server with zero-install bundled distribution
- Two-panel UI: project rail (left) + feature detail panel (right)
- Live updates via file watcher and WebSocket
- Parser with emoji shortcode normalization for cross-format PRD compatibility
- Filters, search, collapsible groups, clipboard actions
- esbuild single-file CJS bundle (911KB) for self-contained distribution
- Pre-commit hook enforces bundle freshness when dashboard source changes
- 75 tests covering parser, scanner, state, watcher, WebSocket, and API

## v1.13.0 - 2026-03-24

Remove session-state protocol from skills.

Dashboard now derives status purely from PRD markdown files and checkpoint dates, not from transient JSON state written by skills. This simplifies the skill lifecycle — no more `session-state.json` writes in dev-resume, dev-checkpoint, or dev-wrapup.

### Removed
- `session-state.json` writes from dev-resume, dev-checkpoint, dev-wrapup
- `session-state.json` reads from dev-board and dev-status agents
- `session-state-schema.md` reference doc

## v1.12.0 — Session-state protocol - 2026-03-23

### What's new

**Session-state protocol** — Skills now write `session-state.json` to `.dev/<feature>/` at key lifecycle points, enabling live session awareness across the workflow.

#### Producers
- **dev-resume**: writes `"active"` on session start, `"gate"` at each phase gate
- **dev-checkpoint**: writes `"idle"` after saving checkpoint
- **dev-wrapup**: writes `"idle"` (conditional — only if session-state already exists)

#### Consumers
- **dev-board**: reads `session-state.json` for gate badges (amber) and active session indicators, with graceful fallback to markdown heuristics
- **dev-status**: shows session status alongside features (Building, Gate)

#### Schema
```json
{
  "status": "active" | "gate" | "idle",
  "phase": <number | null>,
  "gate_label": <string | null>,
  "since": "<ISO 8601 timestamp>"
}
```

### Bug fix

- **dev-checkpoint**: Fixed Step 9.5 (branch/worktree proposal on first checkpoint) being consistently skipped — renamed to Step 10 with a required-check callout

## v1.11.0 — Feedback Learning for dev-wrapup - 2026-03-14

## What's New

### Feedback Learning Loop for `/dev-wrapup`

The wrapup skill now learns from your decisions over time. Every time you accept, skip, or reroute a finding, your choice is recorded to `.dev/wrapup-feedback.json`. In subsequent sessions, the skill reads that history and adjusts its behavior:

- **Skip patterns** — Finding types you consistently skip (≥70% skip rate) are suppressed unless exceptionally specific and actionable.
- **Reroute patterns** — If you regularly reroute a finding type to a different destination than proposed, the skill defaults to your preferred destination going forward.
- **Accept patterns** — Finding types you consistently accept are prioritized.
- **Trend detection** — When your recent preferences diverge from historical patterns, the skill favors recent behavior.

### Auto-compaction

The feedback file auto-compacts after 30 sessions, summarizing older records into aggregate statistics while preserving the 20 most recent sessions as raw data. This keeps the file lean without losing learning signal.

### No action required

The feedback loop is fully automatic. Just keep using `/dev-wrapup` as usual — it gets better with each session.

## v1.10.2 — Checkpoint workflow setup improvements - 2026-03-13

## What's changed

- **Branch option for workflow setup**: The checkpoint skill now offers a choice between creating a worktree or just a branch when setting up a dedicated workflow for a feature
- **First checkpoint only**: The workflow setup prompt is now properly skipped on subsequent checkpoints — it only appears when `checkpoint.md` is created for the first time
- **Extracted worktree guide**: Moved workflow setup instructions into a dedicated `references/worktree-guide.md` for better maintainability
- **Documentation**: Added `/dev-board` skill to CLAUDE.md structure and README skill listing

## v1.10.1 — Fix username hallucination in script paths - 2026-03-13

## What's changed

- **Path safety fix**: Skill scripts now use `$HOME` instead of literal home directory paths to prevent username hallucination
- Added public repo privacy rule to CLAUDE.md

## v1.10.0 — Project dashboard skill - 2026-03-13

- Add `agents` array to `plugin.json` for per-skill agent registration
- Add checksum sync tests (8 new tests) to catch drift between duplicated script copies
- Delete shared `plugins/dev-workflow/scripts/` and `plugins/dev-workflow/agents/` directories
- Bump version to 1.9.0

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/andreaserradev-gbj/dev-workflow/compare/v1.8.0...v1.9.0

## v1.8.0 — Session wrap-up skill - 2026-02-23

- Step follows the same conditional skip + STOP gate + accept/decline pattern as the worktree setup step
- Runs a fresh `git status --porcelain` check and derives the commit message from the checkpoint context

## v1.5.5 - 2026-02-14

Add optional worktree setup step to dev-checkpoint (#4)

- Adds a new **Step 9.5** to `/dev-checkpoint` that offers to set up a git worktree-based workflow on the first-ever checkpoint for a feature
- When accepted, creates a feature branch + worktree in a sibling directory, moves PRD files there, commits them, and updates checkpoint frontmatter
- Step is automatically skipped when not on `main`/`master` or when the feature branch already exists

## v1.5.4 - 2026-02-12

Add allowed-tools to skill frontmatter for reduced permission prompts

- Pre-approve `git rev-parse`, `git branch`, `git log`, `git status`, and `Read` in each skill's YAML frontmatter

## v1.4.2 - 2026-02-07

## What's New

### Behavioral Guardrails

- **Checkpoint save-only mode** — `/dev-checkpoint` now strictly saves progress without investigating bugs or starting fixes
- **Pattern-first implementation** — `/dev-resume` reads existing code patterns before writing new code, preventing "built from scratch" issues
- **Step-level confirmation** — `/dev-resume` confirms each step before advancing, preventing premature task jumps
- **PRD constraints section** — `/dev-plan` templates now include reuse requirements, pattern conventions, and anti-patterns to avoid
- **Actionable verification** — Phase verification in PRDs uses checklists with specific commands instead of free-text descriptions
- **Researcher reuse tables** — `prd-researcher` agent now surfaces existing utilities to reuse and anti-patterns to avoid
- **Planner simplicity bias** — `prd-planner` agent prefers reuse over new code and simpler solutions

### Token Optimization

- Reduced command prompt sizes by ~159 lines across all three commands
- Removed redundant sections, condensed verbose instructions, collapsed duplicate template examples

## v1.4.1 - Agent Model Optimization - 2026-02-06
